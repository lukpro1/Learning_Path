# Learning_Path
My journey through web development

## Abstract

I'm tackling my 2018/2019 goals in true "Speedrun" style. My list contains far more courses than I expect I'll be able to complete during these years and in addition my Front End Development path on Openclassrooms, so it's sufficient that I can speedrun the year without running out of items from the list to learn.

Additionally, I'm including a variety of "bonus point" opportunities for reading books, completing projects, and completing algorithmic challenges.

My goal is to see how many points I can rack up by December 31, 2019.

## Rules

1. Always be working on one course.
1. Add bonus objectives from bonus list as often as desired.
1. All Assignments must be complete for course to be considered complete.
